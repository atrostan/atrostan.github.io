Ottawa, ON
\begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt
      \item{Developed a graphical model of supply chain structures to facilitate the automatic detection of underutilized constraints in production processes}
      \item{Implemented specialized vertex contraction and graph partitioning procedures based on heuristics present in graph structures to greatly reduce dataset size and complexity and improve performance of a network-separation algorithm}
      \item{Tested runtime and correctness of community detection algorithms (\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z.pdf}{Leiden}, \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0476.pdf}{Louvain}) to evaluate the feasibility of use on customer product structures}

{\sl Data Scientist, Co-op} \hfill January 2019 - August 2019 \\
Ciena, Kanata, ON
\begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
\item Implemented data transformation pipelines to ingest raw
      customer data from both streaming and batch inputs and 
      assembled preprocessed datasets used for training Neural Networks
      and Ensemble ML classifiers used in production
\item Aggregated and visualized customer devices' alarm occurrence data
      to determine the types
      of facilities that have been shown to experience specific alarms,
      the occurrence frequency of those alarms, and the feature distributions associated with each alarm
\item Researched and cross-validated different multivariate time series classification and forecasting frameworks to inform and justify the use of inference models in production
      %  \item Developed a NiFi template that demonstrated the end-to-end
      %  flow (data acquisition, transformation, and inference making 
      %  in the field) of a General Availability feature that was used 
      %  in Request For Proposal demos to potential customers
